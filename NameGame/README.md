Name Game

This project came from a Brain Tickler in The Bent of Tau Beta Pi (#3 in Summer 2014). The problem posits a game in which players draw names and are out when they draw their own name. It asks for the expected number of rounds and the probability of exactly 2 winners. This project simulates the game in order to experimentally determine the answers.
