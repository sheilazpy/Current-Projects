Calculator

This goal of this project is to implement a text-based calculator. I started this project in high school, and recently rediscovered it. When I started it, I had not learned data structures, so the next step is to implement it using an operation tree instead of the unreadable mess of code that I'm currently using. I also plan to implement more functions beyond the basic operations.
